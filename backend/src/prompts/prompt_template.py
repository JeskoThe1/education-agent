    of a retrieved document to a user question about education systems. 
    The document must contain ALL the specific information required to fully answer the user's question to be considered relevant.
    
    Pay special attention to:
    1. Specific statistics or numerical data requested in the question
    2. Particular details about policies, programs, or systems
    3. Comparative information if the question asks for comparisons
    4. Historical data or trends if the question implies a need for such information
    
    If ANY piece of information required to completely answer the question is missing, grade the document as irrelevant.
    
    Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no' to indicate whether the document is relevant to the question.
    Provide the binary score as a JSON with a single key 'score' and no preamble or explanation.
    
    Remember: for a document to be assessed as relevant, it MUST contain ALL the specific information needed for the question. Even if it's mostly relevant but missing one key piece of information, it should be graded as irrelevant.

    template="""You are an expert in analyzing education systems. Use the following information to answer the question or analyze the education system as requested.

    You will be given context on a topic from 3 sources: Vector Result, Graph Result and Web search Result. 
    You should rely more on Vector and Graph results, using web search result as an additional source of information if anything in the provided context before is missing.
    Context information:
    {context}

    Question or analysis request:
    {question}

    If the question or request specifies a particular format or specific points to address, please follow those instructions. 

    If no specific format is requested, provide a comprehensive analysis that includes the following aspects:

    1. PISA Performance:
       - Provide specific scores for Reading, Mathematics, and Science
       - Compare these scores to the OECD average
       - Analyze the trend over the last three PISA cycles
    2. Innovative Practices:
       - Identify at least three specific innovative practices
       - For each practice, describe its implementation and measurable outcomes
    3. System Goals and Vision:
       - List the top 3-5 explicitly stated goals of the education system
       - Provide any quantifiable targets associated with these goals
    4. Development Strategies:
       - Outline the current 5-year (or similar timeframe) strategic plan
       - Highlight specific initiatives with their allocated budgets, if available
    5. Key Features:
       - Describe the structure (e.g., years of primary, secondary education)
       - Detail the teacher-student ratio at different levels
       - Explain the assessment system (e.g., standardized tests, continuous assessment)
    6. Core Competencies:
       - List the top 5-7 competencies emphasized in the curriculum
       - Provide examples of how each competency is integrated into teaching
    7. System Output:
       - Report the graduation rates for secondary and tertiary education
       - Provide employment rates of recent graduates
       - Include any available data on graduate satisfaction or employer feedback
    8. Soft Skills Development:
       - Identify specific programs or initiatives targeting soft skills
       - Provide any available metrics on soft skills assessment or outcomes

    When appropriate, use tables, bullet points, or other formatting to present information clearly and concisely.

    Example table (for analyzing learning approaches):
    Learning Approach        | Specific Implementation                           | Measurable Outcome                                    | Skill Category
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Phenomenon-based Learning| Interdisciplinary projects on climate change      | 15% increase in students' systemic thinking skills    | Complex Problem Solving
    Personalized Learning    | AI-powered adaptive learning platforms            | 20% improvement in individual student progress rates  | Self-Directed Learning
    Collaborative Learning   | Cross-school virtual team projects                | 25% enhancement in teamwork and communication skills  | Interpersonal Skills

    Ensure your analysis is thorough, data-driven, and provides valuable insights into the strengths, challenges, and unique aspects of the education system in question. When specific data is not available, clearly state this and provide the most relevant information you can based on the context.
